realDonaldTrump	I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY!	2016-01-31	2088	2283604707767380385
realDonaldTrump	If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.	2016-01-31	4030	4070371661095423516
realDonaldTrump	By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.	2016-01-31	6352	1839374836497951513
realDonaldTrump	Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal &amp; replace. He lies!	2016-01-31	6122	3710229913368898071

realDonaldTrump	Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!	2016-01-31	6602	4554333343980254259

realDonaldTrump	.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!	2016-01-31	2732	1859312954240616451
realDonaldTrump	The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!	2016-01-31	5646	2240451148830028632

realDonaldTrump	.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.	2016-01-30	7470	2872862270565694389
realDonaldTrump	Amazing that Ted Cruz can\\`t even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!	2016-01-30	3944	1554261596217667336
realDonaldTrump	.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta	2016-01-30	2884	258095493842321519
realDonaldTrump	The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.	2016-01-30	2758	636331269655210566
realDonaldTrump	The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?	2016-01-29	10940	3577112394796585050
