  <h1>Data-Mining and Clustering</h1>
  <p>
  	This is a homework project for the "Freie Universit√§t Berlin". The idea is to parse the whole data-feed from all tweets of Trump and Hillary for the elections in the united states, save the whole information conveniently in a database and perform data-mining and clustering. The clusters represent hashtags that are very simmilar to each other. Further, one can track how much a single or all hashtags were used throughout the elections.
